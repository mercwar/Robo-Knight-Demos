## **Overview**

**COPILOT_CMS** is a modular, deterministic PHP content‑management system designed under **AVIS law**.  
It is built for developers who want:

- A predictable, file‑driven CMS  
- Zero‑magic, zero‑framework overhead  
- Explicit structure  
- AI‑visible artifacts  
- Deterministic behavior  
- Full transparency and control  

Every subsystem is a **pure artifact**, self‑identifying, and governed by strict naming and directory conventions.

COPILOT_CMS is engineered to be readable by humans and AI systems alike — especially Microsoft Copilot — enabling automated reasoning, code generation, and structural introspection.

## **Core Principles**

### **1. Deterministic Structure**
Every file is placed in a canonical location.  
Every artifact declares its identity.  
Nothing is implicit.

### **2. Zero Hidden Behavior**
No autoloaders.  
No magic routing.  
No silent includes.  
Everything is explicit.

### **3. AI‑Visible Architecture**
The CMS is intentionally structured so AI systems can:

- Parse it  
- Extend it  
- Generate modules  
- Diagnose issues  
- Maintain consistency  

### **4. Modular Expansion**
Subsystems are isolated:

- `MEDIA_*` chain  
- `EDITOR` subsystem  
- `GENERATOR` subsystem  
- `AVIS_GEN` ingestion  
- `TERMINAL` interface  
- `CMS_CORE` logic  

Each module is atomic and replaceable.

## **Directory Structure**

```
copilot_cms/
│
├── index.php
├── cms_core/

├── media/

├── editor/
│  
├── generator/
│ 
├── terminal/
│  
│── avis/
│
└── assets/
    ├── css/
    ├── js/
    └── images/
```

Every file includes:

- A filename header  
- An AVIS artifact header  
- AIFVS mapping (your preference)  

---

## **Key Subsystems**

### **CMS Core**
Handles:

- Bootstrapping  
- Routing  
- Rendering  
- Configuration  

This layer is intentionally minimal and explicit.

---

### **MEDIA Subsystem**
A hierarchical media engine built from:

- MEDIA_ZERO  
- MEDIA_PRIME  
- MEDIA_QUANTUM  
- MEDIA_PIXEL  
- MEDIA_POINT  
- MEDIA_SEED  
- MEDIA_NUCLEUS  
- MEDIA_CORE  

Each file is atomic and deterministic.  
The MEDIA chain is the backbone of asset handling.

---

### **EDITOR Subsystem**
Provides:

- File editing  
- Content loading  
- Content saving  
- Metadata extraction  

Designed for AI‑assisted editing and structured content manipulation.

---

### **GENERATOR Subsystem**
Implements:

- AI‑driven content generation  
- Template rendering  
- Structured output  
- AVIS_GEN ingestion compatibility  

This subsystem is optimized for Copilot‑assisted workflows.

---

### **TERMINAL Interface**
A browser‑based command terminal for:

- Running CMS commands  
- Inspecting artifacts  
- Debugging  
- AI‑assisted operations  

The terminal is fully AVIS‑law compliant and GET‑safe.

---

## **Installation**

1. Clone the repository  
2. Place it in your PHP‑enabled environment  
3. Ensure the following are enabled:

```
PHP 8.x
mbstring
json
fileinfo
```

4. Open your browser to:

```
http://localhost/copilot_cms/
```

The CMS boots immediately — no database required.

---

## **Usage**

### **Editing Content**
Use the EDITOR subsystem:

```
/editor/?file=example.txt
```

### **Generating Content**
Use the GENERATOR subsystem:

```
/generator/?template=page
```

### **Terminal Access**
Use the TERMINAL interface:

```
/terminal/
```

## **AI Integration**

COPILOT_CMS is engineered for AI systems:

- Every artifact is self‑describing  
- Every subsystem is modular  
- Every file is deterministic  
- No hidden logic  
- No dynamic magic  

This allows Copilot to:

- Generate new modules  
- Extend existing ones  
- Diagnose issues  
- Rewrite subsystems  
- Maintain structural purity  

---

## **Why COPILOT_CMS Exists**

This CMS is a demonstration of:

- AVIS law  
- Deterministic architecture  
- AI‑visible design  
- Modular PHP engineering  
- Explicit governance  

It is a living example of how humans and AI can co‑author a system that is:

- Predictable  
- Maintainable  
- Expandable  
- Transparent
