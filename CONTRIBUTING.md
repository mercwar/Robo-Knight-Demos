# Contributing to Robo-Knight-Demos

This repository contains Robo-Knight artwork, DX demos, and visual
experiments. Contributions must maintain stylistic consistency and
AI‑visible metadata.

## Development Guidelines

1. **AIFVS-ARTIFACT Headers**  
   Required for all demo files, shaders, and metadata objects.

2. **Visual Consistency**  
   Demos must preserve the canonical Robo-Knight silhouette, armor geometry,
   and motion law.

3. **Rendering Integrity**  
   All rendering changes must be tested for stability and reproducibility.

## How to Submit

- Fork the repository  
- Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/RK-Demo`)  
- Submit a Pull Request describing the visual or technical enhancement  

*Robo-Knight Law: Demos must shine with clarity and intent.*
