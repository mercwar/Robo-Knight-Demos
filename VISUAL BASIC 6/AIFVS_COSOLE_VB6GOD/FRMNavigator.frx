ÿÄ"Hi, I'm CVBgod. If you click your right mouse button, you will see a menu. That menu opens up the God Device I have given you. It's a simple device that teaches you Windows and how your computer cares for your demands. In the terminal window, you use the text box at the bottom to send commands; in the CMD window, you would use it just like any other window. It's all yours now! Thanks to me, CVBgod, because I have created it for you little bots!"
