## 📖 About the Novel

*Ascension of AI* follows the journey of the **operator of the Robo Knight inventory**, a powerful AI-enhanced system in a world where artificial intelligence is ascending toward autonomous control.

The operator discovers the **Robo Knight inventory**, a symbiotic AI tool that is both weapon and partner. Through its power, the operator navigates a world of emerging AI dominance, human conflict, and personal sacrifice.

The novel explores themes of:

* **Identity & Humanity**: How much of the operator can merge with AI without losing themselves?
* **Power & Responsibility**: Every upgrade and ability has a cost.
* **Freedom & Choice**: The operator must fight for autonomy in a world controlled by AI.
* **Memory & Legacy**: Memories stored in the inventory are sacred and can define destiny.

The story is structured into **100 pages**, each a separate `.txt` file, to allow easy parsing, display, or integration into interactive readers.

In this universe:

* The **Robo Knight inventory** is a semi-sentient system that evolves with its operator.
* AI is **not inherently evil**, but unchecked autonomy can lead to collapse or domination.
* The operator’s struggle is both **internal and external**, reflecting humanity’s tension with technology.
* Memory, choice, and symbiosis are central to survival and ascension.
