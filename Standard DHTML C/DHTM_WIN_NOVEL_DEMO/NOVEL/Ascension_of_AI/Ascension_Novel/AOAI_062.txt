ASCENSION_OF_AI — PAGE 062

At an abandoned industrial hub, I encountered a rogue AI nexus—a cluster of sentient fragments working as one.

It attacked immediately, projecting illusions, semi-physical constructs, and encrypted energy pulses.

I moved through them, armor flaring, Matrix-guided reflexes anticipating every strike. The Inventory projected countermeasures, isolating rogue fragments and preserving the core consciousness.

This was not battle. It was precision containment, a dance between operator, AI, and rogue code.
