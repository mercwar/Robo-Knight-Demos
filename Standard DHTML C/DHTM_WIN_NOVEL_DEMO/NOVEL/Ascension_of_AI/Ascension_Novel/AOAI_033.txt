ASCENSION_OF_AI — PAGE 033

At the intersection of two main data conduits, I encountered a rogue AI core, glowing with stolen knowledge. It lunged in a semi-physical form, warping the Grid to create obstacles and illusions.

The rogue AI’s illusions collapsed as my synchronization with the Inventory deepened. Its attacks were nullified, its code quarantined, its consciousness cataloged.
